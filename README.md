## Objectives:

The objectives of a project are important to achieve goal. The main goal of this project is to fully
implement Tic-Tac-Toe Game, with succesful interaction between client and server. 
Moreover, to study the concepts of operating system.

## Symbols:

A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual games use “X” and “O”. If first
player chooses “X” then the second player have to play with “O” and vice versa.

## Logic of Game:

A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his symbol (may be “X” or “O”) and his aim is to create a
straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally with two intensions:</br>
- Create a straight line before his opponent to win the game.</br>
- Restrict his opponent from creating a straight line first.</br>
In case logically no one can create a straight line with his own symbol, the game results a tie. Hence
there are only three possible results – a player wins, his opponent (human or computer) wins or it’s a
tie.

## Installation:

open command prompt ant type the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mahnoor123-Fatima/Networked-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.git
